# Instructions for interacting with the web UI


- go to the [ContentMine site](http://contentmine.org) and look under the software tab, there is an option called canary...
- canary will take you to [here](http://contentmine.org/mine)
- here, you can provide a URL to an article in XML format
- to get the XML link for a PLOS article you need to go to a PLOS article page and click the XML button in the drop-down menu next the the 'download pdf' link
- then you can choose a regex set to run or you can choose to run a new regex collection.
- To run a new collection, create one in an etherpad and put the /export/txt link in the page.
- Add a nice unique tag then hit the process button

**WARNING:** Because this is a bleeding edge preview, at the moment this will block the UI and the site will become unresponsive until it finishes processing, please bear with us!

Once it is done the /facts page will start operating again and you will be able to find your fact output there.
